		<li>The <mark>float</mark> property was originally designed to allow content to wrap around images</li>
		<li>When we float an element, we take it out of the normal flow of the HTML document. This causes the <b>width</b> of that element to default to the width of the content within it</li>
		<li>The float property relies on an element having a <b>display</b> value of block, and may alter an element's default display value if it is not already displayed as a block-level element</li>
		<li>When you float an element it becomes a block box</li>
		<li>You should always set a width on floated items (except if applied directly to an image – which has implicit width). If no width is set, the results can be unpredictable.</li>
		<li></li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>When we float an element it is shifted to the right or to the left until it reaches the edge of the containing block</li>
				<li>If we then float another element nearby in the same direction, it will be shifted until its edge reaches the edge of the first floating element</li>
				<li>If we float more elements in the same direction they will stack up, but sooner or later we’ll run out of space […] when there is insufficient space on the line, they are shifted downward until they fit.</li>
